The project implements two algorithms-

   1.MinMax Algorithm

   2. Alpha Beta Pruning Algorithm

   
 
The user can select the algorithm by modifying the value of variable algorithmSelection in MyPacManII.java file

The value of 1 simulates the game in MinMax mode
The value of 2 simulates the game in AplhaBeta Pruning mode

Time and Space Complexities of two Algorithms


1.Let "b" be the branching factor - possible number of node moves pacman can take. Since the maze is a grid like structure ,b<=4.

2. Let d be the ply (or the depth of the game state space).

3. Let "b'" be the branching factor - possible number of node moves ghost can take. Since there are four ghost and each can make
a maximum of 3 moves the branch factor become 3^4

Time complexity of an algorithm is determined by number of nodes generated in the worst case 

Space Complexity is calculated as number of nodes in the queue at any time in the worst case


MinMax

Time Complexity in MinMax


In worst case MinMax will generate :
1+4(at depth 1)+4*3^4(at depth 2)+ 4*4*3^4+........4^(d-1)*3^4

Time complexity is exponential O(b^(d-1)) where d is depth of state space tree


At depth d , there are 0(b^(d-1)) unexpanded nodes in tree.

So the Space complexity is O(b^(d-1))

So MinMax has both exponential time and space complexities.


Apha Beta Pruning algorithm

Alpha Beta algorithm can reduce the branch factor by sqrt(b)(for PacMan) or sqrt(b')(for ghost) and depends greatly on the 
ordering in which successor nodes are examined.

In the worst case Alpha Beta has the same time and space complexity as MinMax algorithm O(b^d)
However if the successor nodes are chosen in way that the always the best move(node which maximizes PacMan score if Max or Minimizes PacMan scor if Min node)
is selected as the first alternative, we examine only (2b)^(d/2) leaf nodes at each depth of the tree.

Hence the space and time complexities become O((2b)^(d/2))
